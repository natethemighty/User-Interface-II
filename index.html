        <h2>The Last Software Engineer You Will Ever Need!</h2>
        <p>Computers in general has always been a passion of mine. You can imagine how excited I was when I discovered
            that there was a way to make these magical devices function the way I wanted them to, by speaking its
            language - or as I later found out, its code.</p>
