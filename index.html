            <h2>The Last Software Engineer You Will Ever Need!</h2>
            <p>Computers in general has always been a passion of mine. You can imagine how excited I was when I
                discovered
                that there was a way to make these magical devices function the way I wanted them to, by speaking its
                language - or as I later found out, its code.<br>It all started when I was 14 years old. I was a
                semi-normal autistic kid who was pretty blunt, and
                struggling to understand how people work. I overhead another kid at the distant lunch table talk about
                how awesome and amazing he is because he made a website. When asked how he did it, he responded "I
                understand how computers work in a way very few people can." I was confused, and I asked to see his
                "work." He should me a raw HTML page that looked like it had been written in microsoft word with no
                formatting. I didn't understand how he gained admiration for this text file, glorified as a website.
                <br>That day, I went home, finished my homework, ate my dinner and fired up my trusty Sony Vaio desktop
                from
                2003, and loaded up a search page. I googled "How to make a website from scratch." And thus began the
                long, emotional and joyous journey that I am on today.<br>I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also a
                Full Stack Development student at Lambda School, and a
                Software Engineering student at University of Maryland. I want to use these skills to serve the
                disability community, by providing software that is accessible to everyone, regardless of what kind of
                device is being used. Essentially, I want to make "cross-platform" software possible between everyday
                computing devices, and assistive technology.</p>
